    "Question 1 : What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "Answer:A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a web service that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It follows the principles of the REST architecture, where each piece of data or functionality is treated as a resource and can be accessed through a unique URL. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it, and the server does not store any session data. They commonly use lightweight data formats like JSON or XML for transferring information. Because of their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with web technologies, RESTful APIs are widely used in modern web and mobile applications to connect the frontend with the backend and enable smooth data exchange between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
    "Answer:Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework in Python that is commonly used for building web applications and APIs. It is called a “micro-framework” because it provides only the essential tools needed to get a web server running, while giving developers the freedom to add additional features and extensions as required. Flask is popular for building APIs because it is simple to learn, easy to use, and highly customizable. Developers can quickly create RESTful APIs using Flask’s built-in support for routing, request handling, and JSON responses. Its minimal design makes it ideal for small to medium-sized projects, prototypes, and applications where performance and simplicity are priorities. Flask’s popularity also comes from its strong community support, extensive documentation, and compatibility with many Python libraries, making it one of the most preferred choices for API development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3:What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
    "Answer:In RESTful APIs, HTTP methods are used to perform different actions on resources (like data or objects). The most commonly used HTTP methods are:\n",
    "1. GET – Used to retrieve data from the server. For example, GET /users fetches the list of all users.\n",
    "2. POST – Used to create new data or resources on the server. For example, POST /users can be used to add a new user.\n",
    "3. PUT – Used to update an existing resource completely. For example, PUT /users/1 updates all details of the user with ID 1.\n",
    "4. PATCH – Used to partially update an existing resource. For example, PATCH /users/1 updates only specific details of the user.\n",
    "5. DELETE – Used to remove a resource from the server. For example, DELETE /users/1 deletes the user with ID 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
    "Answer:In Flask, the @app.route() decorator is used to define the URL path (or route) that triggers a specific function when a user visits that URL. In simple terms, it connects a web address to a Python function that runs when someone accesses that address.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return \"Welcome to my website!\"\n",
    "Here, the @app.route('/') decorator tells Flask that when a user goes to the home page (/), the home() function should be executed, and its return value will be shown in the browser.\n",
    "The purpose of @app.route() is to make it easy to map URLs to functions, allowing developers to define what should happen when a user visits different parts of a website or API. It helps in organizing and controlling how requests are handled in a Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
    "Answer:Flask and SQLAlchemy work together to simplify web application and API development in Python.\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework that helps developers build web applications and APIs quickly. It handles tasks like routing URLs, managing requests and responses, and rendering web pages or sending data. Flask provides the structure for the web app but does not handle databases directly.\n",
    "SQLAlchemy, on the other hand, is a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) used with Flask to manage databases more easily. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, developers can use Python code to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy automatically translates Python objects into database tables and vice versa.\n",
    "Together, Flask and SQLAlchemy allow developers to build full-featured applications — Flask handles the web interface and API logic, while SQLAlchemy manages the database connections and data storage efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 6: How do you create a basic Flask application?\n",
    "Answer:Here are the steps to create a basic Flask application:\n",
    "1. Install Flask using pip install flask.\n",
    "2. Create a Python file (e.g., app.py).\n",
    "3. Import Flask and create an app instance: app = Flask(__name__).\n",
    "4. Define routes using the @app.route() decorator.\n",
    "5. Write functions that return responses for each route.\n",
    "6. Run the app with app.run(debug=True).\n",
    "7. Open the local server URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 7:How do you return JSON responses in Flask?\n",
    "Answer:Steps to return JSON responses in Flask:\n",
    "1. Import jsonify from flask.\n",
    "2. Create a route using @app.route().\n",
    "3. Inside the route function, create a Python dictionary or list with the data.\n",
    "4. Return the data using jsonify().\n",
    "5. Run the Flask app and access the route to see the JSON response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Question 8:How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
    "Answer:Here are the steps to handle POST requests in Flask using the request object:\n",
    "1. Import request from Flask:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "2. Create a Flask app instance:\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "3. Define a route that accepts POST requests:\n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def submit():\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()   # Get JSON data sent in the request\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"you_sent\": data})\n",
    "4. Run the Flask app:\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "5. Send a POST request (from Postman or frontend) with JSON data to /submit.\n",
    "6. Flask reads the request data via request.get_json() and you can process or return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 9: How do you handle errors in Flask (e.g., 404)?\n",
    "Answer:Here are the steps to handle errors in Flask (like 404 Not Found):\n",
    "1. Import Flask and render_template or jsonify:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
    "2. Create a Flask app instance:\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "3. Define a custom error handler using @app.errorhandler():\n",
    "@app.errorhandler(404)\n",
    "def page_not_found(e):\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Page not found\", \"status\": 404}), 404\n",
    "4. Run the Flask app:\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "Now, if a user accesses a route that does not exist, Flask will return a JSON response:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"error\": \"Page not found\",\n",
    "  \"status\": 404\n",
    "}\n",
    "This method can be used for other HTTP errors as well (like 400, 500, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 10: How do you structure a Flask app using Blueprints?\n",
    "Answer:Here are the steps to structure a Flask app using Blueprints:\n",
    "1. Create the main project folder:\n",
    "my_app/\n",
    "    app.py\n",
    "    /routes\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        user_routes.py\n",
    "        product_routes.py\n",
    "2. Create a Blueprint in a routes file (e.g., user_routes.py):\n",
    "from flask import Blueprint, jsonify\n",
    "user_bp = Blueprint('user', __name__)\n",
    "@user_bp.route('/users')\n",
    "def get_users():\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"users\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]})\n",
    "3. Initialize the Blueprint in __init__.py (optional for larger apps):\n",
    "from .user_routes import user_bp\n",
    "from .product_routes import product_bp\n",
    "4. Register Blueprints in the main app (app.py):\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "from routes.user_routes import user_bp\n",
    "from routes.product_routes import product_bp\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "app.register_blueprint(user_bp, url_prefix='/api')\n",
    "app.register_blueprint(product_bp, url_prefix='/api')\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Access routes with the Blueprint prefix:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Blueprints helps organize large Flask applications, keeping related routes and logic separate and modular."
